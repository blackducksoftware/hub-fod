# Overview

The Hub Fortify on Demand integration runs in the background as a batch service which will eventually push the open source security risk, license risk and operational risk information at component version origin level for the mapped Black Duck Hub project into your connected Fortify on Demand application. The implementation makes it possible to monitor and manage open source risk in a single view in Fortify on Demand.
